## Introduction
Memi is an app that employs artificial intelligence, as a solution made in order to tackle mental issues that come with age. The app contains four pages: **talk**, **connect**, **friends** and **settings**. 

The first page, **talk** is a Large Language Model chatbot that uses the ChatGPT-3.5 model in order to provide information. Firstly, the user should put their input in the form of text. A Large Language Model (LLM) should take in this input and should formulate a response through the perspective of a reminiscent therapist, with an audible response available. Through Neuro-Linguistic Programming, the conversation is scanned to find potential keywords, and finally through LangChain it ends up summarised.

The second page, **connect** helps users matchmake. 

The third page, **friends** helps users find their friends. 

The fourth page, **settings** helps users customise their experience through the app.
