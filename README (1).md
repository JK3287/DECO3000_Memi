# DECO3000 A5 Memi - by Veronikah McClelland and Justin Kwon

## Introduction
Memi is an app that employs artificial intelligence, as a solution made in order to tackle mental issues that come with age. The app contains two pages: **TALK** and **FRIENDS**. 

The first page, **TALK** is in the form of a Large Language Model chatbot that uses the ChatGPT-3.5 model in order to provide information. Firstly, the user should put their input in the form of text. A Large Language Model (LLM) should take in this input and should formulate a response through the perspective of a reminiscent therapist, with an audible response available. Through Neuro-Linguistic Programming, the conversation is scanned to find potential keywords, and finally through LangChain it ends up summarised. When the user asks for a friend to find, using the Spacy keywords, the chatbot will go through a database of people and try to match keywords in order to find compatitable people.

The second page, **FRIENDS** is built to host a list of friends that the user has found through a consultation with the chatbot from the TALK page.
