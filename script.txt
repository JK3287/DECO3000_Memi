- Demo Script: Scope -
. Problem area - Lonely elderly people who have memory issues
. Australiaâ€™s elderly population is increasing due to its high life expectancy age
. One-fifth of people aged over 55 have mental health issues
. We are trying to help them create new bonds and positive experiences through reminisence therapy
. AI conversation allows us to help each user with more accessible and personalised experiences

- Demo Script: Sources -
. What are the sources of data? 
    - Common Crawl (ChatGPT)
    - ISEAR and WASSA

. How is our data processed? 
    - Input from user through chat
    - Data is interpreted by ChatGPT by having it predict the best response to the input using reminiscence therapy focused rules
    - An output is given to the user that helps continue the conversation
    - Through this constant conversation, keywords are generated from Spacy, which are used to catagorise the session
    - These keywords are then compared with other user's keywords from their own sessions, and if sessions have similar keywords,
      users are recommended to each other to bond through similar experiences

- Demo Script: Models -
. The main page right now is TALK, involving a chatbot made from at least 7 sources
    - Streamlit was used for its ability to rapidly prototype a web application without the need to write for HTML, CSS or 
    Javascript, saving time
    - ChatGPT as a Large Language Model was used to comprehend text as input and generate responses in a manner similar
    to the human language
    - Google's Text-To-Speech API was used to generate auditory responses, as if the chatbot were to talk to users who could hear
    - Spacy as a Natural Language Processing Library was used to tokenise keywords from a user's conversation with the
    chatbot to help categorise conversations and help them meet like-minded people
    - LangChain was used in order to enhance the capabilities of ChatGPT, in regard to simplifying information, to summarise
     conversations
    - Audio_Recorder_Streamlit was used in order to record auditory input, with OpenAI's Whisper performing Automatic Speech
    Recognition as it transcribes what is being said

- Demo Script: Function -
. Three pages: TALK, CONNECT and FRIENDS
. As of now, TALK is the only page
. CONNECT should help find other users through means of searching with keywords found from NLP
. Finally FRIENDS are made through CONNECT and users should see them whenever they want
