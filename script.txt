- Demo Script: Scope -
. Memi - Reminiscence therapy chatbot that utilises ai to create conversations focusing on memories with its users
. Target Audience - Elderly people
. Problem area - High rates of loneliness and isolation in elderly people, which may lead to depression and dementia
. We found that reminiscence therapy is a great way to help elderly people feel more confident and positive about themselves,
  and Memi focuses on this
. We are also trying to help them create positive experiences through making new bonds with others by connecting them with 
  other users using Memi with similar experiences
. Benefits of using AI - more accessible (cheaper than person to person therapy, and can be accessed any time from home)
  and more personalised experiences

- Demo Script: Sources -
. What are the sources of data? 
    - Common Crawl (ChatGPT)
    # ISEAR and WASSA

. How is our data processed? 
    - Input from user through chat
    - Data is interpreted by ChatGPT by having it predict the best response to the input using reminiscence therapy focused rules
    - An output is given to the user that helps continue the conversation
    - Through this constant conversation, keywords are generated and stored, which are used to show what topics and themes the 
      conversation is about
    - These keywords are then compared with other user's keywords from their own sessions, and if sessions have similar keywords,
      users are recommended to each other to bond through similar experiences

- Demo Script: Models -
. The main page right now is TALK, involving a chatbot made from SEVEN sources so far, with input from the user
    - Streamlit was used for its ability to rapidly prototype a web application without the need to write for HTML, CSS or 
    Javascript, saving time
    - Audio_Recorder_Streamlit was used in order to record auditory input and provide a sound file
    for transcription
    - OpenAI's Whisper as ASR takes in sound as input and provides a transcript
    - ChatGPT as a LLM comprehends text as input and due to a specific prompt template targeted towards
    reminiscence therapy, generates responses in a manner similar to the human language, making Memi an
    effective agent
    - Google's Text-To-Speech API takes text and generates auditory responses as output, 
    as if the chatbot were to talk to users who could hear
    - Spacy as a NLP (Natural Language Processing) Library takes the conversation as input and provides keywords 
    to help users meet like-minded people
    - Finally, LangChain takes the conversation, then shortens it into a summary
   

- Demo Script: Function -
. Three pages: TALK, CONNECT and FRIENDS
. As of now, TALK is the only page
. CONNECT should help find other users through means of searching with keywords found from Spacy
. Finally FRIENDS are made through CONNECT and users should see them whenever they want
